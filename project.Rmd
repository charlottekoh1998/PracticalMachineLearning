## Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

## Goal
The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. You should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

## Reproducibility
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(rattle)
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(corrplot)
library(randomForest)
library(RColorBrewer)
```  
Finally, load the same seed with the following line of code:  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
set.seed(56789)
```  

## Getting Data
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/Charlotte/PracticalMachineLearning")
trainUrl <-"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
testUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
trainFile <- "./data/pml-training.csv"
testFile  <- "./data/pml-testing.csv"
if (!file.exists("./data")) {
  dir.create("./data")
}
if (!file.exists(trainFile)) {
  download.file(trainUrl, destfile = trainFile, method = "curl")
}
if (!file.exists(testFile)) {
  download.file(testUrl, destfile = testFile, method = "curl")
}
rm(trainUrl)
rm(testUrl)
```  

## Reading Data
Reading the 2 CSV files into data frames.
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
trainRaw <- read.csv(trainFile)
testRaw <- read.csv(testFile)
dim(trainRaw)
dim(testRaw)
rm(trainFile)
rm(testFile)
```  
The training data set contains `r dim(trainRaw)[1]` observations and `r dim(trainRaw)[2]` variables, while the testing data set contains `r dim(testRaw)[1]` observations and `r dim(testRaw)[2]` variables. The `classe` variable in the training set is the outcome to predict.  

## Cleaning Data
To remove observations with missing values and meaningless 

1. We clean the <b>Near Zero Variance</b> Variables.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
NZV <- nearZeroVar(trainRaw, saveMetrics = TRUE)
head(NZV, 20)
training01 <- trainRaw[, !NZV$nzv]
testing01 <- testRaw[, !NZV$nzv]
dim(training01)
dim(testing01)
rm(trainRaw)
rm(testRaw)
rm(NZV)
```  

2. Removing some columns of the dataset that do not contribute much to the accelerometer measurements.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
regex <- grepl("^X|timestamp|user_name", names(training01))
training <- training01[, !regex]
testing <- testing01[, !regex]
rm(regex)
rm(training01)
rm(testing01)
dim(training)
dim(testing)
```  

3. Removing columns that contain `NA's`.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
cond <- (colSums(is.na(training)) == 0)
training <- training[, cond]
testing <- testing[, cond]
rm(cond)
```  

Now, the cleaned training data set contains `r dim(training)[1]` observations and `r dim(training)[2]` variables, while the testing data set contains `r dim(testing)[1]` observations and `r dim(testing)[2]` variables.  

Correlation Matrix of Columns in the Training Data set.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
corrplot(cor(training[, -length(names(training))]), method = "color", tl.cex = 0.5)
```  

## Partitioning Training Set
Split the cleaned training set into a pure training data set (70%) and a validation data set (30%), and the validation data set is used for future cross validation.
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
set.seed(56789) # For reproducibile purpose
inTrain <- createDataPartition(training$classe, p = 0.70, list = FALSE)
validation <- training[-inTrain, ]
training <- training[inTrain, ]
rm(inTrain)
```  
The Dataset now consists of `r dim(training)[2]` variables with the observations divided as following:  
1. Training Data: `r dim(training)[1]` observations.  
2. Validation Data: `r dim(validation)[1]` observations.  
3. Testing Data: `r dim(testing)[1]` observations.  

## Data Modelling
### Decision Tree  
We fit a predictive model for activity recognition using <b>Decision Tree</b> algorithm.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
modelTree <- rpart(classe ~ ., data = training, method = "class")
prp(modelTree)
```  

Now, we estimate the performance of the model on the <b>validation</b> data set.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
predictTree <- predict(modelTree, validation, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(validation$classe, predictTree)
accuracy <- postResample(predictTree, validation$classe)
ose <- 1 - as.numeric(confusionMatrix(validation$classe, predictTree)$overall[1])
rm(predictTree)
rm(modelTree)
```  

The Estimated Accuracy of the Random Forest Model is `r accuracy[1]*100`% and the Estimated Out-of-Sample Error is `r ose*100`%.  

### Random Forest
We fit a predictive model for activity recognition using <b>Random Forest</b> algorithm because it automatically selects important variables and is robust to correlated covariates & outliers in general.  
We will use <b>5-fold cross validation</b> when applying the algorithm.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
modelRF <- train(classe ~ ., data = training, method = "rf", trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", 5), ntree = 250)
modelRF
```  

Now, we estimate the performance of the model on the <b>validation</b> data set.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
predictRF <- predict(modelRF, validation)
confusionMatrix(validation$classe, predictRF)
accuracy <- postResample(predictRF, validation$classe)
ose <- 1 - as.numeric(confusionMatrix(validation$classe, predictRF)$overall[1])
rm(predictRF)
```  

The Estimated Accuracy of the Random Forest Model is `r accuracy[1]*100`% and the Estimated Out-of-Sample Error is `r ose*100`%.  
Random Forests yielded better Results, as expected!  

## Predicting the Manner of Exercise (Test Data Set)
Apply the <b>Random Forest</b> model to the original testing data set downloaded from the data source while removing the problem_id column first.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
rm(accuracy)
rm(ose)
predict(modelRF, testing[, -length(names(testing))])
```  

## Generating Files for the assignment
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("C:/Users/Charlotte/PracticalMachineLearning/problem_id_",i,".txt")
    write.table(x[i], file = filename, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
  }
}
```  
Generating the Files.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
pml_write_files(predict(modelRF, testing[, -length(names(testing))]))
rm(modelRF)
rm(training)
rm(testing)
rm(validation)
rm(pml_write_files)
```
